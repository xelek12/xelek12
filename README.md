# 👋 Hey there, I'm Cody

Welcome to my corner of GitHub.

This repo doesn’t hold a traditional project – it’s the README that shows up on my profile. Just a little space to share my dev personality and keep things from feeling too empty.

## 🧠 What I do

- I write code that usually works on the first try (after 37 commits).
- Mostly into **JavaScript**, **Python**, and exploring cool frameworks that I probably won’t finish learning.
- Build-first, Google-later kind of dev.  

## 🛠️ Not-a-Project

```bash
# Placeholder project to keep the lights on
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.git
cd not-a-project
code .
````

This isn’t a real repo, but who needs rules?
